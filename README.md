# OpenGL Learning Playground

This project serves as a learning playground for understanding OpenGL through a tutorial.

## Tutorial

I am currently following the tutorial available [here](https://glium.github.io/glium/book/README.html). This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on OpenGL concepts and programming techniques. The goal of this project is to implement and experiment with the concepts covered in the tutorial.
